# Sysresources

'sysresources' is a simple command line tool that prints the following system resources statistics to the screen: disk, ram, percent cpu used, system uptime and running processes.  This tool is constructed for linux systems only. There is nothing too special about this gem, but it does organize the above information into one place and eliminates the need to run numerous system commands.    
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sysresources'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sysresources

## Usage

simply run 'sysresources' at the command line.    

## Development
